# 🎓 Peer Teach Platform

**Empowering Knowledge Exchange – One Peer at a Time**

**Peer Teach** is a collaborative skill-sharing platform where users can connect, teach, and learn from each other. Built with modern technologies and UI libraries, it fosters community-based learning through real-time bookings, profile showcasing, and direct peer-to-peer interaction.
